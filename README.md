# Machine Learning for Networking

This repository contains exercises, resources, and information for learning machine learning concepts and applying them to networking. 

## Videos

* [Networking
  videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpherdrLyny-zJw95jcE-uJkcsIAG1MEn),
  which
  provide necessary networking background. You are strongly encouraged to
  develop a firm understanding of networking, as this course will apply
  concept 
* Machine learning videos provide backgound on machine learning concepts.
* The course [wiki](https://github.com/noise-lab/ml-networking/wiki) has more
  resources, including links to past projects, readings, and project ideas.

## Structure

A general structure for a short course on this material is as follows. Each
lecture has (1) a set of notes and slides explaining concepts, (2) an
accompanying Jupyter Notebook with example applications from networking to
make the concepts more concrete and further expand on networking concepts.

| 10     | Automated Machine Learning     | nprintML                      |

All of the notebooks, notes, and slides for each lecture can be found in the
respective directory.

## Repository

The repository has the following organization:

* [slides/](./slides/) - slides for each lecture
* [notes/](./notes/) - notebooks for each lecture
* [activities/](./activities/) - notebooks for each lecture
